# CycleGAN-for-Image-to-Image-Translation-with-Keras
The Cycle Generative Adversarial Network, or CycleGAN, is an approach to training a deep convolutional neural network for image-to-image translation tasks.  Unlike other GAN models for image translation, the CycleGAN does not require a dataset of paired images. For example, if we are interested in translating photographs of oranges to apples, we do not require a training dataset of oranges that have been manually converted to apples. This allows the development of a translation model on problems where training datasets may not exist, such as translating paintings to photographs.
